# CovidDetectionUsingX-ray
To use CNN model to classify if the given X-ray is of a covid-19 positive patient or a normal patient
We have use the covid_chest_x-ray dataset present on github to get the x-ray images of the Covid detected lungs from the url https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset
And to get the x-ray images of normal lungs we used the kaggle dataset from the url https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. And using the CNN model and Image Agumentation model was designed and good accuracy is found on validation dataset
